# Statistical Learning/ Machine Learning in R
>*Statistical learning theory is a framework for **machine learning** drawing from the fields of statistics and functional analysis.*

This repository contains exercises from a course in computational statistics, starting with simple Monte Carlo simulations to become familiar with this topic. 

I highly recomment you the following book:
> *An introduction to statistical learning* 
James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2013). An introduction to statistical learning (Vol. 112, p. 18). New York: springer.
